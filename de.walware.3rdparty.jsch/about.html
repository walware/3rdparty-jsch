<h3>Cryptography</h3>

<h4>Export Control</h4>
<p>The plug-in contains encryption software.  The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession,
and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's
laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this
is permitted.</p>

<h4>Encryption Items</h4>
<p>The plug-in contains the implementation of a keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). It also relies on cryptographic algorithms 
provided by the Java&trade; Cryptography Extension (JCE) to support the implementation of the Secure Shell 2 (SSH2) protocol.</p>

<p>The following Java classes contain encryption items (the plug-in may contain both binary and source code):</p>
<ul>
